## Tasks

---

### Task 7.1

1. Create a new service called `authorization-service` at the same level as Product and Import services with its own `serverless.yml` file. The backend project structure should look like this:

```
   backend-repository
      product-service
      import-service
      authorization-service
```

2. Create a lambda function called `basicAuthorizer` under the same Serverless config file (i.e. `serverless.yaml`) of the Authorization Service.
3. This lambda should have at least one environment variable with the following credentials:

```
  {yours_github_account_login}=TEST_PASSWORD
```

- `{yours_github_account_login}` - your GitHub account name. Login for test user should be your GitHub account name
- `TEST_PASSWORD` - password string. Password for test user must be "TEST_PASSWORD"
- example: `johndoe=TEST_PASSWORD`

3. This `basicAuthorizer` lambda should take _Basic Authorization_ token, decode it and check that credentials provided by token exist in the lambda environment variable.
4. This lambda should return 403 HTTP status if access is denied for this user (invalid `authorization_token`) and 401 HTTP status if Authorization header is not provided.

_NOTE: Do not send your credentials to the GitHub. Use `.env` file and `serverless-dotenv-plugin` serverless plugin to add environment variables to the lambda. Add `.env` file to `.gitignore` file._

```
  .env file example:
    vasiapupkin=TEST_PASSWORD
```

### Task 7.2

1. Add Lambda authorization to the `/import` path of the Import Service API Gateway.
2. Use your `basicAuthorizer` lambda as the Lambda authorizer

### Task 7.3

1. Request from the client application to the `/import` path of the Import Service should have _Basic Authorization_ header:

```
  Authorization: Basic {authorization_token}
```

- `{authorization_token}` is a base64-encoded `{yours_github_account_login}:TEST_PASSWORD`
- example: `Authorization: Basic sGLzdRxvZmw0ZXs0UGFzcw==`

2. Client should get `authorization_token` value from browser [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

```
  const authorization_token = localStorage.getItem('authorization_token')
```

### Task 7.4

1. Commit all your work to separate branch (e.g. `task-7` from the latest `master`) in your own repository.
2. Create a pull request to the `master` branch.
3. Submit the link to the pull request for crosscheck

## Evaluation criteria (70 points for covering all criteria)

---

Provide your reviewers with the link to the repo, client application and URLs to execute the `/import` path of the Import Service`

- `authorization-service` is added to the repo, has correct `basicAuthorizer` lambda and correct `serverless.yaml` file
- Import Service `serverless.yaml` file has authorizer configuration for the `importProductsFile` lambda. Request to the `importProductsFile` lambda should work only with correct `authorization_token` being decoded and checked by `basicAuthorizer` lambda. Response should be in 403 HTTP status if access is denied for this user (invalid `authorization_token`) and in 401 HTTP status if Authorization header is not provided.
- Client application is updated to send "Authorization: Basic `authorization_token`" header on import. Client should get `authorization_token` value from browser [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

## Additional (optional) tasks

---

_NOTE: Recommended for personal growth and further interviews, but this part would not be evauated on cross-check._

- **+30** - Client application should display alerts for the responses in 401 and 403 HTTP statuses. This behavior should be added to the `nodejs-aws-fe-main/src/index.tsx` file.
- **Just Practice, No Evaluation** - Add Login page and protect `getProductsList` lambda by the Cognito Authorizer
  - Create Cognito User Pool using a demo from the lecture. Leave `email` in a list of standard required attributes. Checkbox `Allow users to sign themselves up` should be checked. Also, set `email` as an attribute that you want to verify.
  - Add `App Client` to the User Pool
  - In the `App Client Settings` section select all `Identity Providers`. Fill the `Callback URL(s)` field with your Client Application URL (i.e. `http://localhost:3000/`). Allow only `Authorization code grant` OAuth Flow. Allow all `OAuth Scopes`
  - Create Domain name
  - After all of these manipulations, you can open your `Login Page` by clicking on the `Launch Hosted UI` link in the `App Client Settings`
  - Provide this link to your reviewers. The reviewer can just confirm that everything works for him too.
  - Add Cognito authorizer to the `getProductsList` lambda. Use `Authorization` as a `Token Source`
  - How to make sure that everything works as expected:
    - Open Login Page and `Sign Up` a new user. Use a real email address to create this user
    - Verify user using code from the email
    - After verification and after every login you will be redirected to the Client application. URL should contain `id_token` which can be used to access the `getProductsList` lambda
    - Call `getProductsList` lambda using `id_token` as a value for the `Authorization` header
  - Remove authorization from the `getProductsList` after your task will be checked
