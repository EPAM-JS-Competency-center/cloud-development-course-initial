## Tasks

---

### Task 2.1

**Manual Deployment**

1. In the AWS Console **create** and **configure** an S3 bucket where you will host your app (follow instructions in training materials).
2. **Build** and **manually upload** the MyShop! app to the created S3 bucket. **Check** if the app is available through the Internet over `http://{your-bucket-name}.s3-website-{aws-region}.amazonaws.com` .
3. **Create** a CloudFront distribution for your app as it was described in training materials. **Check** your S3 bucket policy changes. **Check** if the app is available through the Internet over given CloudFront URL.
4. **Make** some minor but visible changes in the app, **build** and **upload** them to your bucket, and create CloudFront distribution invalidation.

### Task 2.2

**Automated Deployment**

1. **Add** and **configure** _serverless_ and _serverless-finch_ plugin. Add necessary npm script(s) to build and deploy your app from your machine in an automated way. **Check** if everything works correctly for you.
Here's a [Demo repo](https://github.com/boale/serverlessTestApp) as an example.

_NOTE: After uploading an application's build to the S3 bucket you need to manually create a CloudFront invalidation._
2. **Destroy** the created AWS infrastructure (S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution) from the previous part and steps. **Make sure** nothing is left.
3. **Add** and **configure** `serverless-single-page-app-plugin` as it is implemented in the demo repository. **Add** necessary npm script(s) to build, upload to your S3 bucket, and invalidate CloudFront cache from your machine in an automated way. **Check** if everything works fine and all changes appear on the Web.

_NOTE: Now that you have this plugin you don’t need to manually create CloudFront invalidations any more._

### Task 2.3

1. Store the links to CloudFront URL and S3-website in README.md file.
2. Commit all your work to separate branch (e.g. `task-2` from the latest `master`) in your own repository.
3. Create a pull request to the `master` branch.
4. Submit the link to the pull request for crosscheck

## Evaluation criteria (70 points for covering all criteria)

---
- S3 bucket has been created and configured properly. The app has been uploaded to the bucket and is available though the Internet. Nothing else has been done.
  _(Link to S3 bucket/website is provided. There is no Pull Request in the YOUR OWN frontend repository.)_
- In addition to the previous work a CloudFront distribution is created and configured properly and the site is served now with CloudFront and is available through the Internet over CloudFront URL, not S3-website link (due to changes in bucket’s policy...).
  _(Link to CloudFront website is provided. S3-website shows 403 Access Denied error. There is no Pull Request in the YOUR OWN frontend repository.)_

## Additional (optional) tasks

---
- **30** - `Serverless-finch` and `serverless-single-page-app` plugins are added and configured. The app can be built and deployed by running npm script command.
  _(Link to CloudFront website is provided. PR with all changes is submitted in the YOUR OWN frontend repository and its link is provided for review.)_

NOTE: YOU SHOULD WORK IN YOUR OWN FORKED REPOSITORY, NOT IN COMMON
