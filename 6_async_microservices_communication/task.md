## Tasks

---

### Task 6.1

1. Create a lambda function called `catalogBatchProcess` under the same Serverless config file (i.e. `serverless.yaml`) of the Product Service which will be triggered by an SQS event.
2. Create an SQS queue called `catalogItemsQueue`, in the resources section of the same `serverless.yml` file.
3. Configure the SQS to trigger lambda `catalogBatchProcess` with _5 messages_ at once via `batchSize` property.
4. The lambda function should iterate over all SQS messages and create corresponding products in the products table.

### Task 6.2

1. Update the `importFileParser` lambda function in the Import Service to send each CSV record into SQS.
2. It should no longer log entries from the _readable stream_ to CloudWatch.

### Task 6.3

1. Create an SNS topic `createProductTopic` and email subscription in the resources section in `serverless.yml` of the Product Service.
2. Create a subscription for this SNS topic with an `email` endpoint type with your own email in there.
3. Update the `catalogBatchProcess` lambda function in the Product Service to send an event to the SNS topic once it creates products.

### Task 6.4

1. Commit all your work to separate branch (e.g. `task-6` from the latest `master`) in your own repository.
2. Create a pull request to the `master` branch.
3. Submit the link to the pull request for crosscheck
