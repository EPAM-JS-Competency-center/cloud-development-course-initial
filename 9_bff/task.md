# Task 9 (Backend For Frontend)

## Prerequisites
---

- The task is a continuation of **Homework 8**
- The task should be done in the backend repo - the same repo with **product-service** and **import-service** services
- **product-service** and **CART** services should exist and work in your application

## Tasks
---

### Task 9.1
 
Create a folder for the **bff-service** in the same level as for other services in the repo. Create an **express** application in this folder, that listens for all requests and redirects those requests to the appropriate services based on variables provided by the **.env** file.

**bff-service** workflow example:
* Call **bff-service** by the URL: **{bff-service-url}**/**{recipient-service-name}**?var1=someValue
  * **{bff-service-url}** - for example, http://localhost:3000
  * **{recipient-service-name}** - ‘cart’ or ‘product’ (you can use any other mapping of your choice)
  * ?var1=someValue - query string
* Get **recipientURL** from the env variables using **{recipient-service-name}** as a key
* Get request **method** (GET, POST, etc.)
* Make a new request to the needed service using the appropriate **method** and **recipientURL**
* **bff-service** should return the result of the recipient’s request

If **bff-service** cannot find **recipientURL** by the **{recipient-service-name}**, return a 'Cannot process request’ error message with status 502.  
**bff-service** should return the same status code and error message that the recipient service returns to the **bff-service** in case of any error on the recipient service side.  

### Task 9.2

Deploy **bff-service** with Elastic Beanstalk. 
* Platform should be **Node.js**
* Application name must follow the following convention **{yours_github_account_login}-bff-api**
* Use the **--cname** option **{yours_github_account_login}-bff-api-{environment_name}**
* Use the **--single** option

**bff-service** should work only with requests from the **product-service** and **CART** services.  
All **product-service** and **CART** services methods should work correctly if requested via **bff-service**

## Evaluation criteria (each mark includes previous mark criteria)
---

Provide your reviewers with the following information:
- link to the repo
- **product-service** service API endpoint URL
- example of the **create product** API call with all needed information: URL, payload, headers, etc.
- **CART** service API endpoint URL
- **bff-service** service URL
- example how to call **product-service** and **CART** services via **bff-service** service URL   
---
* **3** - A working and correct **express** application should be in the **bff-service** folder. Reviewer can start this application locally with any valid configuration in the **.env** file and this application should works as described in the task 9.1
* **5** - The **bff-service** should be deployed with Elastic Beanstalk. The **bff-service** call should be redirected to the appropriate service : **product-service** or **CART**. The response from the **bff-service** should be the same as if **product-service** or **CART** services were called directly.

## Application Functionality (**MUST HAVE**)
--- 

By this point your application must be able to do:

1. Products representation on Home page should be based on product-service API.
2. Products are still static, but products are hardcoded on BE product-service.
3. Product images are not randomly generated on client side. Product image, same as another product model information should be stored on BE side RDS.
4. Products might be created through CSV product file import from client side.
5. Cart might be created with appropriate product set.
6. Auth logic should be in place 

## Additional (optional) tasks
---

* **+1** - Add a cache at the **bff-service** level for a request to the **getProductsList** function of the **product-service**. The cache should expire in 2 minutes.  
How to test:
  * Get products list
  * Create new product
  * Get products list - result shouldn’t have new product
  * Wait more than 2 minutes
  * Get products list - result should have new product
* **+1** - Use **NestJS** to create **bff-service** instead of **express**
